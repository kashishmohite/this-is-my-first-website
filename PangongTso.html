               <b><p> Historically, the lake is viewed as being made up five sublakes, which are 
                connected through narrow water channels. The name Pangong Tso only applied to the
                 westernmost lake that is mostly in Ladakh. The main lake on the Tibetan side is 
                 called Tso Nyak (the "middle lake"). It is followed by two small lakes called Rum Tso.
                  The last lake near Rutog is called Nyak Tso again.[5][6] The whole lake group was and is still
                   often referred to as Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo</p></b>
