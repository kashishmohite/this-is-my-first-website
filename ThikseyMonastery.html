               <b><p> hiksey Monastery or Thiksey Gompa (also transliterated from Ladakhi as Thikse, Thiksay or Tikse) is a Buddhist monastery affiliated with the Gelug school 
                of Tibetan Buddhism. It is located on top of a hill in Thiksey approximately 19 kilometres (12 mi) east of Leh,
                 in the Ladakh region of northern India.[1] It is noted for its resemblance to the Potala Palace in Lhasa, 
                 Tibet, and is the largest monastery in central Ladakh, notably containing a separate set of buildings for female
                  renunciates that has been the source of significant recent building and reorganization.</p>

                     Tsongkhapa gave one of his disciples, Jangsem Sherap Zangpo (Wylie: shes rab bzang po), a small statue of Amitayus
                      (the saṃbhogakāya form of Amitābha), containing bone powder and a drop of Tsongkhapa's own blood.
