              <b> <p>Hemis Monastery is a Himalayan Buddhist monastery (gompa) of the Drukpa Lineage,
                 in Hemis on the bank of the Indus River, Ladakh, India. Situated 45 km from Leh, it was re-established
                  in 1672 by the Ladakhi king Sengge Namgyal. The annual Hemis festival honouring Padmasambhava is held there in
                   early June.

                Hemis village is located 40 km southeast of Leh on Leh-Manali Highway and under-construction Bhanupliâ€“Leh line.

                    In 1894 Russian journalist Nicolas Notovitch claimed Hemis as the origin of an otherwise unknown gospel, 
                    the Life of Saint Issa, Best of the Sons of Men, in which Jesus is said to have travelled to India during his 
                    'lost years'. According to Notovitch, the work had been preserved in the Hemis library and was shown to him by the
                     monks there while he was recuperating from a broken leg, and his Sherpa guide translated it for him. Notovich's 
                     version of the manuscript was translated from Tibetan to Russian to French to English. However, historians view 
                     Notovitch as having fabricated the evidence, which he allegedly admitted himself.[3][4] Bible scholar Bart D. 
                     Ehrman states that "Today there is not a single recognized scholar on the planet who has any doubts about the matter. 
                     The entire story was invented by Notovitch, 
                    who earned a good deal of money and a substantial amount of notoriety for his hoax.
