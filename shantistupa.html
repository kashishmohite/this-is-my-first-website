               <b><p> Shanti Stupa is a Buddhist white-domed Stupa (chorten) on a hilltop in Chanspa, Leh district, Ladakh,
                 in north India.[1] It was built in 1991 by Japanese Buddhist monk Gyomyo Nakamura. The Shanti Stupa holds the 
                 relics of the Buddha at its base, enshrined by the 14th Dalai Lama.[2] The Stupa has become a tourist attraction not 
                 only due to its religious significance but also due to
                 its location which provides panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.
                 Construction of the Shanti Stupa began in April 1983 under the supervision of Bhikshu Gyomyo Nakamura, and Kushok Bakula, 
                 a Head Lama of Ladakh, helped his activities from New Delhi because he was member of the Minority Commission of Govt of India.
                  The project was built with the help of Ladakhi Buddhists,
                  who offered voluntary labour, and financially supported by Japanese Buddhists as well as Indian supporters. </p></b>
